# Judicial Reports Data Extractor

## Overview
The "Judicial Reports Data Extractor" is an intricately crafted Python script designed to efficiently extract vital information from the "Prevention of Future Deaths Reports" on the UK Judiciary website. This automation tool swiftly captures key metadata, including report ID, date, receiver, and content, organizing it into a structured CSV file. To enhance its functionality, the script incorporates a text-scanning feature, enabling extraction from PDF files consisting mainly of image-based content. Ideal for researchers, analysts, and stakeholders, it offers seamless integration into diverse data analysis workflows, providing enhanced accessibility and insights for mitigating recurring fatalities.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/judicial-reports-data-extractor.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pdf2image pytesseract Pillow PyMuPDF
    ```

3. **Tesseract OCR:**
    Download and install Tesseract OCR from [https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). Ensure that the `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd` variable in the script points to the correct Tesseract executable on your system.

## Usage
To employ the extractor, populate the `urls` variable in the script with the desired report URLs. Execute the script, and it will generate a CSV file (`output.csv`) containing the meticulously extracted information.

```bash
python extractor.py
```

## Dependencies
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to fetch web pages and PDFs.
- `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content.
- `pdf2image`: For converting PDF pages to images.
- `pytesseract`: For performing OCR on images to extract text.
- `Pillow`: For working with images in Python.
- `PyMuPDF`: For extracting text from PDF documents.

## Configuration
The script includes variables that can be configured to adjust its behavior:
- `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd`: Path to the Tesseract executable.
- `section1_start` and `section1_end`: Markers for extracting the first section of the report.
- `section2_start` and `section2_end`: Markers for extracting the second section of the report.

## Error Handling
The script incorporates robust error handling for scenarios where specific sections are not found or exceptions occur during the extraction process. Error messages are displayed in the console, and default values are assigned to the corresponding variables.

## Example Usage
An example usage section is provided in the script, showcasing how to use the extractor with a list of sample URLs. Users can customize the `urls` list to include the specific reports they want to analyze.

```python
urls = [
    "https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/report1/",
    "https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/report2/",
    # Add more URLs as needed
]
```
